      My name is Julia Kiser and I am working to become a full stack web developer. I am currently enrolled in the
      Part-Time Coding Bootcamp through the University of North Carolina-Charlotte.
      While working to obtain my certification in web development, I work full-time for BAE Systems, Inc as a time
      collections specialist.
      <br>
      I have a passion for learning and I am excited to continue to grow and develop my skills in this class so that I
      can make a career change and work full time as a web developer.
      For fun I love to go to the movies as every movie is better in the theater. I also enjoy playing or cuddling my
      dog Kona.
      <br>
      My favorite place to vacation is Hawaii with my fiance and I am looking for to going back hopefully next year.
