      <h4>Get to know me</h4>
      Hey everyone! Welcome and thank you for visiting my portfolio. My name is Julia Kiser and I reside in Charlotte,
      NC. Currently, I am working to become a full stack web developer and am currently enrolled in the
      Part-Time Coding Bootcamp through the University of North Carolina-Charlotte. Go Niners! While in the process of
      obtaining my certification in web development, I work am also working full-time for BAE Systems, Inc as a time
      collections specialist. If you haven't already guessed it, "Yes! I am absolutely looking to change careers and
      would love to join your team!."
      </p>
      <p class="p2">
      <h4>Why hire me?</h4>
      Why? Well, I have a passion for learning and since I was young I have been interested in computer science. The
      only part is without guidance at a young age, I took myself down the road of business instead. It didn't turn
      out too bad as I obtained a Masters Degree in Business Administration from Gardner-Webb University. Go Dawgs!
      Now I am excited to take my education, work experience and skills to continue to grow and develop in web
      development
      throughout this course and beyond.
      </p>
      <p class="p3">
      <h4>Just for fun</h4>
      I love movies and spending time with all the people I love! My favorite activity is going to the movies as every
      movie is better in the theater. I have 1 dog and her name is Kona, our best days are spent cuddling on the couch.
      Lastly, I love to travel with my fiance and our favorite place to go is Hawaii.
